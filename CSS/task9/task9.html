FIFAe World Cup 2025™ is an official eSports world championship co-hosted by Konami Digital Entertainment Co., Ltd. and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA®). 
This year 12 national representatives emerged victorious from regional qualifiers and will now compete in the console and mobile divisions for the tournament’s highest honours and be crowned champions.

For the console division, it will be held in a 2v2 format with players participating in teams of three whereas the mobile division will be a 1v1 format. 
Both divisions will feature players from 12 different countries where they compete through a group stage and knockout stage before battling it out in the finals.

To celebrate the start of the tournament, users can participate in an eFootball™ campaign and can obtain free special items. 
Logging in during the campaign period rewards users with different items.

Additionally, users also receive one player item each day from a curated special player list. Users can also take on a Squad Challenge Event where clearing challenges with specific rules will reward them with various items. 
The campaign period is from December 4th – December 18th.

Coinciding with this campaign, a new game update has been implemented to adjust game balance and adds various features and gameplay elements to enhance the experience. 
A new particular feature analyses in-game player tendencies and adds an “Advice” feature where players and coaches provide feedback in real-time that could serve as a catalyst for improvements in tactics.

Another feature is the “Analysis” which aggregates and analyses the results of each user’s last 10 PvP matches and visualises their playstyle via comparison graphs and data against opposition from Division 1 – Division 4 users.
