            Robert Bruce was a famous king of Scotland. He ruled over the country with a good name and fame. 
            His army was defeated 6 times by his enemies. At last, he lost his Kingdom. 
            He fled away to save his life. He took shelter in a cave. He was in a sad mood.
            One day, the king was lying in the cave and thinking about how he could get back his kingdom. 
            Suddenly, he noticed a spider trying to reach the ceiling of the cave. 
            It failed six times and became successful on the 7th attempt. This sight greatly inspired Robert Bruce. 
            He assembled a formidable army and launched a series of attacks against his enemies. At last, he defeated them and got back his kingdom.
